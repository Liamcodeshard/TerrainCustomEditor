# TerrainCustomEditor

This is a project creating a custom unity editor tool for terrain layers

I started out with simple affects to the terrain
Then building in randomness with noise waves
Later bringing in veronoi tessalation to help multiple noise waves interact in a natural way

I then created a way to set textures to certain parts of the heightmap to give a sense of natural geological seperation
